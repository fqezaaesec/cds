## Key features

- **Cross-platform** - CDS provides components for both React DOM and React Native. We go to great lengths to ensure that the source code is as identical as possible across React and React Native without compromising on platform-specific features.

- **Powerful theming** - The ThemeProvider can be used to define a custom theme for your application supporting light and dark mode.

- **Rich styling capabilities** - Components are designed to integrate with third-party libraries like styled-components, and to be customizable via theming, props, StyleProps, classnames, and inline styles.

- **Subcomponent composition** - Components are built using smaller subcomponents that can be fully customized or replaced via props.

- **Accessibility** - Components are accessible out of the box, and can be customized to different accessibility standards.

## Web-only features

- **Atomic static CSS** - CSS is compiled to atomic static classnames at library build time.

- **Responsive styles** - Components support responsive styles out of the box. Use the responsive syntax to adjust layouts and styles based on device breakpoints without writing custom media queries.

- **CSS layers** - All CSS is added to the `cds` layer. This allows you to easily override CDS styles with your own styles.

- **Polymorphic components** - Components can be rendered as different HTML elements or as other components.

## Constraints

Coinbase apps have unique performance and build requirements that necessitate specific constraints in CDS.

:::tip
**All of these constraints can be removed by compiling the CDS source code yourself.**
:::

If you find CDS too limiting, you may want to compile it from the source to remove these constraints, or you may still find CDS valuable as a fork or reference.

### Web styles are compiled at library build time

Web styles are compiled at library build time, not at app build time.

Compiling CSS at application build time adds significant latency to the build process. Instead, building CSS when we publish the CDS library keeps our app builds extremely fast. However, this means that you can't customize the responsive breakpoints without compiling CDS yourself.

### Automatic management of CSS imports

Static CSS imports are automatically managed by CDS components.

The order of CSS imports is important and changes the specificity of styles. If you manually import CSS files in each component, you can easily break the specificity of the styles - or cause non-deterministic styles when using Suspense. If you manually import CSS files all in one place, component styles can't be tree shaken when not in use.

CDS components will always automatically import the necessary static CSS in the correct order. This is done to ensure style specificity is deterministic and always correct, and enables CSS tree shaking based on component usage. However, this means that you can't tree shake the default styles for a component at app build time if you've overridden them.
